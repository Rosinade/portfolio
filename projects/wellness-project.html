        <h2>How to prototype an MVP of a wellness app: Balanced</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Wellness industry</h3>
          <p>The health and wellness industry has been experiencing immense disruption due to advancements in technology. Today’s consumers are embracing wearable technologies and other activity-tracking products more than ever before. The omnipresence of the smartphone has spawned a massive market for mobile health and wellness apps.</p>

    </figure>

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>Carrying out a survey seemed to be the most effective and necessary to answer this question and then identify the pain points in people’s lives to determine the direction of our product, we’ve got 89 answers in total.
          <ul>
            <li>66% check every 15 minutes or more</li>
            <li>78% check phone as soon as they wake up</li>
            <li>A majority gets encouraged by positive information as a mean to change</li>
          </ul>
          And…What bothers users the most about their screen time?
        </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="../assets/images/wellness/wellness-research.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
        <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">Research</figcaption>
      </figure>

          <p>The histogram above shows us that the screen time disturbs our users more mainly on:
            <ul>
              <li>their free time</li>
              <li>their productivity</li>
              <li>their sleep</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            We noticed some important quotes:
            <ul>
              <li>“Screen time affects my mental health”</li>
              <li>“As I can’t do it on my own, I need help to change my habits”</li>
              <li>“I want to be able to entertain myself without my phone”</li>
              <li>“My last hour on my phone didn’t give me ANYTHING”</li>
              <li>“I don’t feel good about it, but we have no choice. I don’t have any solution, so it’s impossible”</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="quote text-center text-muted font-italic"cite="Verbatim">"People want to Scroll less and Live more"</p>
          <br>
          <p>To dig deeper, we conducted 6 interviews in Job to be done framework. We wanted to identify the actions that these people are trying to perform for their wellness, to understand their contexts and the way that they use their phones, their feelings… and then try on our side to solve the real problems of real people.<br>
          <br>We learned that users want to feel less guilty and to learn how to use well their phones, to give them the feeling that they don’t waste their time and regain control of their phone and their lives.<br>
          <br>Here are the insights:
          <ul>
            <li>Statistics with comparisons: “21h on your phone: we know you’re a master chef–it’s the same as cooking 5 Michelin dinners!”</li>
            <li>Feel in control, empowered: “I don’t feel apathetic anymore!”</li>
            <li>A real friend: “Apple statistics makes me feel bad, I want to talk with a buddy”</li>
            <li>Smart stats: “See my activity at a glance”</li>
            <li>Win at life: “I spend my time well–I’m productive”</li>
            <li>Actionable help: “A flip off function that accessible”</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Define</h3>

          </figure>


        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>Below are Sara’s journey and her interactions with the Life Screen Balance app. An overview of her typical day.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/wellness/wellness-userjourney.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
          <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">User Journey</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>MVP</h3>
        <p>Now we’ve gotten to know better Sara and her habits, we have to generate a lot of ideas. To propose the best solution, we use different ideation tools:
          <ul>
            <li>Worst idea: The concept is to write several bad, stupid, illegal ideas to come up with fresh, good ideas</li>
            <li>Round Robin: The concept of this tool is one person of the team starts to draw the idea and then, the next person continues to build it.</li>
          </ul>
          Thanks to all those tools, we’ve got several design opportunities, but we have to keep some of them and get the most valued functionality efficiently.<br>
          <br>MoSCoW is a way to prioritize stories, features, tasks or requirements. That system makes you break all your features down into 4 categories.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/wellness/wellness-mvp.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
          <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">The MoSCoW Method</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now we know all features that we must have and we want to organize them. We need architecture and structure so we built a site map.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/wellness/sitemap-wellness.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
          <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">The MoSCoW Method</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>This sitemap shows you how the app will be composed, you can see the onboarding and the different steps to set preferences, this is important to have a personalized app for Sara; the homepage and his 3 main categories: statistics, let’s detox and challenge.</p>

        <h3>Moodboard</h3>
          <p>To provide our solution, we want to create an app that better suits our users. We want to bring a feeling of calm, inspiring, restful, and motivating.<br>
          <br>To fit better with our values, which are:
          <ul>
            <li>Inspiring</li>
            <li>Calming</li>
            <li>Insightful</li>
            <li>Friendly</li>
          </ul>

          We created a moodboard, that will help us to know in which art direction we want to go and to stay aligned with our ideas.</p>

          <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/wellness/wellness-moodboard.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">The moodboard</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>We picked up pictures that represent nature, lightness, zen with soft colors.
          We also created a logo, the aim was to build a brand that represents our values so we want to create a flat logo and simple, something rounded and light but strong because all our app will be light, so all our main identity will be based on this logo.</p>

          <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/wellness/wellness-styletile.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            <figcaption class="text-center text-muted">From mi-fi to hi-fi</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>To bring a feeling of something calm and relaxing, we created a shade of light blue for the background. And to play with contrasts, our primary colors are solid with dark grey and light orange.<br>
            <br>To feel more light and flat, all our icons are designed with outlines at 2.6pt, and our buttons are rounded at 5pt.
            Now it’s time to see how into mid-fi we designed our hi-fi prototype:</p>

          <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/wellness/wellness-midfi-hifi.gif" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
          </figure>

        <h3>Onboarding</h3>
          <p>
            It is important to define the user’s preferences so that the app is personalized according to their wishes and objectives.</p>

            <figure>
              <img src="../assets/images/wellness/wellness-onboarding.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            </figure>

        <h3>Homepage</h3>
          <p>On the homepage, the user can see his main statistics of the day and below his inspirations tips that he received.
              He can also look for other inspirations with the search bar and tags, but we decided to not add more than 10 pictures because our concept is to help users reduce their screentime.</p>

              <figure>
                <img src="../assets/images/wellness/wellness-homepage.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              </figure>

        <h3>Statistics page</h3>
            <p>The statistics page allows the user to check all his stats by category and in summary. He can see all the stats of the month and when he clicks on a category card, he can have the trend by day, by week, by month, and by year thanks to the dropdown list button.</p>

            <figure>
              <img src="../assets/images/wellness/wellness-statistics.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            </figure>

        <h3>The detox page and challenge page</h3>
            <p>Those pages allow the user to set up all preferences about screen detox, to have notification tips or not, to set the flip function and the slow scrolling.<br>
              He can also participate in challenges about different topics with his friends and family and get rewards if he wins.</p>

              <figure>
                <img src="../assets/images/wellness/wellness-detox.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              </figure>

            <p>We have also added some micro-interactions to show how the app works with scrolling and dragging. Some elements are animated to help the user better see his progress.<br>
            <br>You can watch the video below to see the demonstration:</p>

            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azYS_TwfQuY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <br>
          <h3>Desirability test</h3>
            <p>To make sure that our app fits with our brand value, we conducted some desirability testing with users. We asked them to give us 5 words when they saw our app, this corresponds to the first 5 seconds of their feeling.


              <figure>
                <img src="../assets/images/wellness/wellness-desaribility.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              </figure>

              <p>You can see that the words conform to our brand attributes and that we can continue. But we also know that it can seem too calm or too zen and not readable enough at times.
                We wanted to evoke something airy and light that we hesitate to play with bold fonts.
                But for there to be enough contrast and readability it may be necessary to make a concession because it is essential that it please our users but above all that it is accessible and usable.</p>
